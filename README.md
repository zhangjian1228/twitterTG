Using Twitter API, write a program that inspects CNN’s twitter account (https://twitter.com/cnn) by doing the following:
1- Aggregate news/tweets posted on that account, by month and dump the aggregation results into a table. It’s sufficient to go back in time as far as 1st Of January 2016.

2- For each Tweet after 1st Of January 2016, expand it’s shortened URL (if it contained any), and store the Mapping in another table.


Bonus: Make this an HTTP service, where the user provides the twitter account that they want to do (1) on through a form, and their email address. When the results are ready, it will send them to the specified email address as a file (preferably a CSV file).

Notes: Please host the code on a Github repository, and push your changes there.
